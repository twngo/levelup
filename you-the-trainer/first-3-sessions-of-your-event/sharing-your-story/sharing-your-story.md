summary: "名牌有助互相認識，但它們無法刺激啟動有效聚會所需的互動與能量。因為我們在此介紹一些創意活動來協助學員和訓練員互相了解彼此的參加動機和對相關議題的觀點。"

#### 以創意啟動訓練
雖然可請學員以傳統熟悉的方式來進行自找介紹（姓名、工作單位、等等），但不妨試試其它更創意的方法來啟動訓練工作坊。利用創意的自我介紹，也為此活動定調為有趣、投入和參與式的活動。

記住這可能是某些人第一次在大團體內講話與分享，因此對他們而言壓力很大。開始之前，確定把場地佈置成為每個人都能方便看到彼此，在談話時能進行眼神交流。如果有學員是以代號或匿稱來參與，也事先跟他們溝通，不必說出自己的真實姓名。

## 創意的自我介紹

### 全體活動

#### 喜愛的東西
每個人介紹自己時除了講出名字、服務單位和以下資訊：
- 最喜愛的顏色
- 特異功能（如果有的話）
- 用一個字來形容現在的心情
- 喜愛的東西、書、電腦、網站或冰淇淋口味等。

#### 私人個性
發給每個人一張紙，用它來描繪自己的手掌，在每隻手指上寫下一個（和本次訓練有關的）關鍵字或片語：
- **姆指：**　最擅長的技能
- **食指：**他們的目標
- **中指：**　感到挫折的東西
- **無名指：**　最愛的東西
- **小指：**　深藏不露的技能或天賦

#### 關鍵細節和活動
發給每個人一張紙，指示學員在紙畫出自己的自畫像，以便稍後向團體介紹使用，並至少分享五個私人生活的重要細節，例如生命中五個重要事件，導致他們投身當前的工作或是來參加這場訓練。

這個活動特別適合工作人員會議或是已曾合作過的人們相聚在一起的場合。確認每張紙上*沒有*寫下當事者的名字。每位學員把自己的紙貼在教室牆上後，請大家像參觀畫廊一樣，鼓勵來猜猜畫像中的人是哪一位學員
<br><br>

### 成員對配或小組活動  
請大家環顧教室，找到其中最陌生的一個人，與之搭配組隊。當配對完成之後（如果有人落單，可以有一組由三人組成），給大家十分鐘時間進行二人小組之間的互相認識，稍後向整個團體來介紹分享。

提醒學員還剩多少時間，十分鐘時間到了，請大家恢復大團體集合，並請每個人以不超過六十秒的時間來介紹自己的伙伴。

### The Spectrogram
This is one of the most versatile exercises a facilitator can incorporate. Great for introductions, the Spectrogram furthermore combines movement with participants taking a physical stand on their perspectives.

Allen Gunn and the folks at **Aspiration Tech** have a detailed description of how to facilitate the Spectrogram, and it is included as an activity in the LevelUp curriculum, but here below are some simple guidelines to get you started.

The Spectrogram is designed to elicit perspectives and insight from participants. Without intentional facilitation, it can easily lose focus or inspire arguments or confrontation. Make sure you provide clear instructions and are a proactive, engaged facilitator.

#### Setting Up & Introduction
Draw a straight line in the middle of the room, going from one wall or barrier to the opposite; or, encourage everyone to imagine a line.

Invite everyone to stand on the line in relation to how far they travelled to get to the event (ex: one side of the wall is one block, and the other is 10,000 kilometers). Ask a few people to note their name and where they came from. Celebrate and thank those who came from far away, and give thanks to everyone who has invested their time with the group for the gathering.

Introduce the Spectrogram exercise. Note to participants that they will be asked their views on a number of statements and be invited to physically place themselves in relation to one wall, which is “Strongly Agree” and the opposite wall, which is “Strongly Disagree.”

#### Spectrogram Statements
Have **statements** (*not questions!*) prepared in advance, and written out on large paper so everyone can see them clearly. They should be short, memorable, engaging and relevant to both everyone in attendance and the content of the gathering (ex: if the gathering was for human rights advocates, a good statement would be “The International Criminal Court is a great tool for justice.”).

- Once participants have arranged themselves along the line, or "spectrum", you can ask people from throughout the range of perspectives to briefly explain to the larger group why they are standing where they are.

Invite people to shift their placing when they hear a compelling point.Be careful to ensure participants do not shame or argue with the opposite side, but make the case as to *why* they are *where* they are.

#### Creating Statements　
Organizers or facilitators can create the spectrogram statements in advance, or they can crowd-source them at the event. To do this, get participants into small groups of 3 to 5 people and provide each group 5 to 10 minutes to list out as many statements that relate to the gathering as they can think of. 

- Once their time is up, they should choose their favorite three statements and be prepared to share them with the group. Additionally, you can use the Spectrogram exercise to gauge interests or commitments for moving forward. 

One favorite statement for this exercise is, “I know exactly what I want to accomplish during this gathering”, which helps tease out motivations and give facilitators an idea of how intentional or prepared participants are. Another fun one is, “I will take shareable notes during the event”.

### When the Wind Blows
This is a fast way to gauge participants’ experience, interests and background. Start with everyone against one wall and explain that there are strong wind gusts coming from the wall. Whenever the wind blows for a particular skill, experience or attribute, the persons with that attribute will blow into the room and then back to the wall.

- For example, the facilitator would say, “There’s a great wind for all of the parents,” and all of the parents would move forward from the wall into the room and then back to the wall.


Some examples of wind gusts that may be good to explore: The wind blows for brothers / sisters / artists / technologists / singers / people who can ride a bike / people who think there are aliens / people who sing in the shower.

This is a fun, quick exercise that allows folks to make some connections with others who may share certain attributes, interests or skills. Lastly, if movement amongst participants is an issue, you could do this exercise with people standing or holding up hands or paper.
